# Low level driver for ADS68xx with XMC4500

Example of low level driver for analog to digital SPI converter ADS68xx working with
Infineon [XMC4500][xmc4500]

---

You can easy port it to [XMC4500 RelaxKit][xmc4500_kit]
- Change I/O configuration for ADS68xx and preprocessor definition from `XMC4500_F144x1024` to `XMC4500_F100x1024` 

---

Software was written in [Dave IDE][dave_ide] and compiled by [xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC v11.3.1-1.1][xpack]

### Mode of operation

There are possible service ADS86xx in two different modes:

- Default mode is interrupt mode.
Conversion start is forced by interrupt from *CCU81_0* timer at frequency `ADS86_SAMPLING_FREQ = 100kHz`.
Next rising edge of RVS pin (which means conversion is done) force interrupt which trigger SPI communication.
Finish of SPI communication trigger last ISR. Data is read and put to *DAC* output.

- Polling mode in main loop.
All triggers are done in function `ADS86XX_ServiceInPolling`.
Rising edge of ALARM pin force interrupt which set flag `readAdsAlarms`.
If `readAdsAlarms` is set alarm register of ADS86xx is read in function `ADS86XX_ServiceInPolling`.

## Tests ADS8695

Input of ADS86xx is configured as`ADS86_RANGE_SEL_BI_0_625_VREF`, so accept Â± 2.56V at input. Service in ISR mode.

#### Step response

`Ch_1` input signal, `Ch_2` output signal from DAC channel 0 of XMC4500

#### Histogram

Input of ADS86xx is configured as`ADS86_RANGE_SEL_BI_1_25_VREF`. Input signal is 0V.
Number of samples 2^16, fs = 100kHz.
