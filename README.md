# Low level driver for TI ADS68xx (16-bit or 18-bit SPI ADC) with XMC4500

Example of low level driver for analog to digital SPI converter TI ADS68xx (16-bit or 18-bit) working with
Infineon [XMC4500][xmc4500]

---

You can easy port it to [XMC4500 RelaxKit][xmc4500_kit]
- Change I/O configuration for ADS68xx and preprocessor definition from `XMC4500_F144x1024` to `XMC4500_F100x1024`

Software was written in [Dave IDE][dave_ide] and compiled by [xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC v11.3.1-1.1][xpack]

### Mode of operation

There are possible two different modes of operation:

- Default mode is interrupt mode.
Start of conversion is forced by timer with sampling rate`ADS86_SAMPLING_FREQ = 100kHz`, interrupt `ADS86_Sampling_Isr`.
Rising edge at RVS pin (which means conversion is done) forces interrupt `ADS86_RVS_PIN_Isr` which triggers SPI communication.
Finish of SPI communication triggers last interrupt `ADS86_RxFifo_Isr`. Data is read and put to *DAC* output.

- Polling mode in main loop.
All triggers are done in function `ADS86XX_ServiceInPolling`.
Rising edge at ALARM pin forces interrupt which sets flag `readAdsAlarms`.
If `readAdsAlarms` is set alarm register of ADS86xx is read in function `ADS86XX_ServiceInPolling`.

## Tests ADS8695

Input of ADS86xx is configured as`ADS86_RANGE_SEL_BI_0_625_VREF`, so accept Â± 2.56V at input. Service in ISR mode.

#### Step response

`Ch_1` input signal, `Ch_2` output signal from DAC channel 0 of XMC4500

#### Histogram

Input of ADS86xx is configured as`ADS86_RANGE_SEL_BI_1_25_VREF`. Input signal is 0V.
Number of samples 2^16, fs = 100kHz.

## Design low-pass Butterworth IIR filter

In folder *filter_py* ther is python script for design low-pass Butterworth IIR filter.

For example, 4th order low-pass Butterworth IIR filter was designed using two *Second Order Section SOS*.
Calculated coefficients for SOS section and graphs obteined from `sos_filter.py`:

```c
#ifndef SOS_COFF_H_
#define SOS_COFF_H_

#define SOS_COFF_NUM_OF_STAGES (2)

static filter_iir_2_f32_t s0 = FILTER_IIR_2_INIT(
1.86824893E-08f,
3.73649787E-08f,
1.86824893E-08f,
1.95685128E+00f,
-9.57394597E-01f);

static filter_iir_2_f32_t s1 = FILTER_IIR_2_INIT(
1.00000000E+00f,
2.00000000E+00f,
1.00000000E+00f,
1.98157908E+00f,
-9.82129258E-01f);

static filter_iir_2_f32_t * s[SOS_COFF_NUM_OF_STAGES] = {&s0, &s1};

#endif /* end of SOS_COFF_H_ */
```
